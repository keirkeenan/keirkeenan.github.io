I am an undergraduate student at Columbia University in SEAS studying Computer Science. I have experience creating full-stack applications in Python, and creating client-server applications in C. I'm currently working on a mobile app using react native, firebase, and solidity. I am passionate about building resilient and scalable applications that people are excited to use.
